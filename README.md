# Python @tail_call_optimized
Fast infinite tail call recursion for python. 

This decorator implementation was thrown together with the help of 
ChatGPT 4. The code for finding the largest factor was mine, and I
didn't like the recursion limits of Python, so added the 
@tail_call_optimized decorator that I had ChatGPT 4 write.

I know I'll want to use this in other projects, so I'm saving the
example here for myself and anyone else who wants to use it.
